# Alert_Sender
The repository is created to send an alert (SMS, Email, etc.) in case of an event

Regarding the sent alert using SMS, we are using Twilio service wherein there would be an initial credit to start the trial and paid options afterwards. The user needs to receive credentials like Account SID and Auth Token from Twilio as well a Twilio phone number. In our created app, the event that may lead to alert is just a simple example of asking the user to send an alert.
