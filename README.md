# Alert Sender app
The repository is created to send an alert (SMS, Email, etc.) in case of an event

Regarding the sent alert using SMS, we are using the Twilio service, which provides an initial credit to start the trial, with paid options available afterward. To use the service, the user needs to obtain credentials, such as the Account SID and Auth Token, from Twilio, as well as a dedicated Twilio phone number. In our app, the event that may trigger an alert is a simple example that prompts the user to send the alert.
